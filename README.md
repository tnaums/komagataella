# komagataella

## Description

This package analyzes DNA sequence files for pPICZ expression plasmids.
These plasmids are commonly used to express recombinant proteins in the yeast
*Komagataella phaffii* (*Pichia pastoris*). It locates the coding
sequence for the recombinant protein, outputs protein fasta files, and
summarizes information for the protein.

There are two major use cases:
1. you are a protein scientist with lots of these files
2. you are reading a published manuscript about a recombinant protein produced in *K. phaffii* and want to take a closer look
