# komagataella

## Description

This package is for analyzing DNA sequence files from pPICZ and pGAPZ expression plasmids.
These plasmids are commonly used to express recombinant proteins in the yeast
*Komagataella phaffii* (*Pichia pastoris*). The program extracts the coding
sequence for the recombinant protein and produces a protein summary.

There are two major use cases:
1. to assist in organizing and documenting a plasmid sequence database from a personal strain collection
2. to allow automated analysis of proteins encoded by plasmids linked to published manuscripts


## Installation
Steps to install and run your project.

## Usage
Example files are included in `data/`. Each file is placed inside of unique folder; for example: data/pTAN121/pTAN121.fa. New files can be added similarly. The DNA sequence fasta files must end in either `*.fa` or `*.fasta`.

To run the program, type `python3 main.py`. This will launch an interactive menu, allowing file selection.
